# NYXOS-core
Nyxzon’s AR/VR adaptive system core — building NyxOS with Nyx for diverse real-world environments
# Nyxzon – NyxOS with Nyx

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 – Core Build  
**Funding Alignment:** Amber Grant + Micro Grants

---

## Mission
Nyxzon is building **NyxOS** with **Nyx** — a modular, neuro-adaptive AR/VR assistant that adapts to real-world environments and diverse users. This project combines AR SDK integration, secure cloud infrastructure, AI processing, and targeted real-world testing to validate system reliability in complex, unpredictable conditions.

---

## Phase 1 – Core Build (Weeks 0–6)
- Integrate AR SDK + Unity toolchain
- Set up secure cloud hosting + CI/CD pipeline
- Establish LLM API pipeline with cost controls
- Implement baseline security stack (MFA, endpoint protection, secrets management)
- Create internal test harness and telemetry framework

---

## Phase 2 – Targeted Real-World Testing (Weeks 6–12)
- Rent **lab space** (lab, innovation hub, or controlled short-term rental)
- Test in varied conditions: noise, low-light, reflective surfaces, fast gestures, multi-surface anchoring
- Document pass/fail outcomes and remediation steps
- Conduct privacy and security audits based on live telemetry

---

## Next Steps
- Complete Phase 1 infrastructure setup  
- Prepare and execute Phase 2 testing plan  
- Document results and integrate feedback into Phase 3 scaling strategy
